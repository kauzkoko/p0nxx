          In a galaxy not so far away, a visionary scientist has unearthed the
          ancient game of Pong within the hallowed halls of a museum. Inspired
          by its simplicity, a groundbreaking solution emerges to tackle the
          energy crisis plaguing the cosmos.

        <div>
          As the scientist embarks on a mission, a celestial power generator is
          conceived in orbit, designed to capture the elusive starstrucks. These
          luminous entities, bouncing within a colossal cube, hold the key to
          unlimited power â€“ a beacon of hope for a galaxy in need.
        </div>
        <div>
          Yet, there's a twist in this cosmic tale. With each collision, the
          starstrucks dismantle the cube's protective walls, demanding swift
          reconstruction to maintain the delicate balance. The fate of the
          universe now rests in the hands of those who can strategically
          activate and rebuild the walls, confining the celestial ball within
          the cube.
        </div>
        <div>
          Only two walls may be activated at once, requiring a dance of
          destruction and reconstruction. As the galaxy faces an energy-starved
          future, a new hope emerges. Will the heroes rise to the challenge,
          mastering the cosmic ballet and harnessing the boundless power of the
          starstrucks? The adventure unfolds in "Star Wars: The Cosmic
          Conundrum." May the force be with them.
